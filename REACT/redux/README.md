This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# redux
1. 实现todolist
2. 加入redux
3. actionType整合
4. 使用后 actionCreator 同意创建action

# 总结 redux的设计使用原则
1. store 是唯一的
2. 只有store能改变自身内容 
3. reducer 是一个纯函数 // 纯函数指的是，给定的输入就一定就会有固定的输出，不会有任何副作用。

# redux中核心的API
1. createStore 创建store
2. store.dispatch 用于派发action
3. store.getState 获取store中所有的数据
4. store.subscribe store中的数据发生改变，接受的回调函数就会执行。用于监听store中数据的修改


# UI组件与容器组件的拆分

# 无状态组件

# Redux中发送异步请求获取数据
